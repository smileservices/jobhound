# jobhound
Job crawler and aggregator

Crawls jobs and indexes them in elasticsearch. Serves API for querying. API access is key based and throttled. No anonymous access. Easily extendable to add more sites to be crawled. 

A ReactJs frontend has been added for browsing and searching through the records using the API list endpoint.
